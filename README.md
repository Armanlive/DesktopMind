## App Name
**DesktopMind**

## how to run 
1.Open a Terminal
2.npm install
3.npx tsc
4.npx webpack
5.npm start

How the Application Works
Electron opens a desktop window.
The left panel is a placeholder for your desktop/app view.
The right panel is a chat interface (like ChatGPT) for AI commands.
You can type commands (e.g., "Find errors", "Open VSCode").
The app will mock responses or use OpenAI (if you configure your API key).

## Core Features

1. **Error Detection**
   - Uses AI to observe the desktop screen and detect coding errors in real time.

2. **Debugging Suggestions**
   - Employs a large language model (LLM) to suggest solutions and debugging steps for detected errors.

3. **Task Automation**
   - Automates desktop tasks such as opening applications and managing files.

4. **User Interface**
   - Clean, efficient interface for communication via text or voice.
   - Split-screen layout for desktop view and AI feedback.

## Style Guidelines

### Colors

- **Primary:** Deep Indigo (#4B0082)
  - Represents intelligence, depth, and focus areas (headers, highlights).
- **Background:** Dark Gray (#222222)
  - Used for main backgrounds to reduce eye strain.
- **Accent:** Teal (#008080)
  - Used for notifications, interactive elements, and highlights.

### Typography

- **Font:** Clean, monospace font (`Fira Mono`, `Menlo`, `Consolas`, or `monospace`)
  - Ensures code readability and a tech-focused aesthetic.

### Icons

- **Style:** Simple, outlined icons
  - Used to represent tasks, actions, and applications.
  - Should be minimalist and consistent in line weight.

### Layout

- **Split-Screen**
  - Left: Live desktop view (or app context)
  - Right: AI feedback, error detection, chat, and suggestions
- **Responsive**
  - Should adapt nicely to different screen sizes.
- **Spacing**
  - Generous padding and margin; clear separation between functional areas.

### Animations

- **Subtle & Non-intrusive**
  - Soft progress indicators for AI processing.
  - Smooth transitions for task completion.
  - Avoid flashy or distracting effects.

### Interactions

- **Text and Voice Input**
  - Support both for user commands and queries.
- **Notifications**
  - Use accent color for important events.
  - Appear as subtle banners or toasts.

## Example UI Components

- **Header:** Deep Indigo background, app name in monospace font.
- **Sidebar (optional):** Outlined icons for task automation (file manager, open app, etc.).
- **Main Panel:**
  - **Left:** Desktop/application view.
  - **Right:** AI chat, error messages, suggestions.
- **Footer:** Current status, subtle animation for AI activity.

## Accessibility

- Ensure sufficient contrast for all text and icons.
- Animations must be optional or subtle for accessibility.
- Support keyboard navigation and screen readers.

## Notes

- Maintain a professional, modern, and tech-savvy aesthetic.
- Focus on usability, clarity, and calmness for long coding sessions.
- All code, errors, and suggestions should appear in monospace for consistency.
